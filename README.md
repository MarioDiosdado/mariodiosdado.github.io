# Responsive Portfolio

In this project we created a portfolio website. It's meant to be a presentation of my achievments as a programer.
We have a navigation bar and a footer on every page.

It has 3 main sections:

1. About Me `index.html`
1. Potfolio `portfolio.html`
1. Contact `contact.html`

This project is responsive and was completed mainly using **bootstrap.**

A `style.css` file was created for specific additions to the style of the site.
